// Networking
//
// Intent: Centralize all network communication with remote APIs and services.
//
// This directory is for code that communicates with backend servers, third-party APIs,
// or any remote data sources. Keep networking logic separate from business logic and UI.
//
// Common components you might add here:
// - API client for making HTTP requests
// - Request/response models specific to your API
// - Authentication and token management
// - Error handling for network failures
// - Network reachability monitoring
//
// Design decisions you'll make:
// - Which networking library to use (URLSession, Alamofire, custom)
// - How to structure requests and endpoints
// - Authentication strategy (tokens, OAuth, certificates)
// - Caching and offline support approach
// - Error handling patterns
//
// See docs/guides/architecture.md for dependency injection patterns.

import Foundation

// This file exists to maintain directory structure in Xcode.
// Delete this file when you add your first networking implementation.
